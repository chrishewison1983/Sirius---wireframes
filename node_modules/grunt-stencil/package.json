  "readme": "# grunt-stencil\n\nStencil is a [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) plugin for templating that generates static HTML files from given components. Stencil provides the following:\n\n- A way to modularise your HTML source files: each file can include an arbitrary number of partial files, or be wrapped with a template file.\n- Built in support for [the doT.js templating language](http://olado.github.io/doT/index.html), which allows passing of arbitrary variables to your HTML files.\n- Built in support for markdown\n- Meta data headers in the beginning of each file to specify variables that should be used in the file (that are accessible from partials included in the file, and templates the file is injected into).\n\n## Documentation\n\nSee the __[Wiki pages](https://github.com/cambridge-healthcare/grunt-stencil/wiki)__ for full documentation.\n\n## Getting Started\nThis plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.1`\n\nIf you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:\n\n```shell\nnpm install grunt-stencil --save-dev\n```\n\nOnce the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:\n\n```js\ngrunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-stencil');\n```\n\n## The \"stencil\" task\n\n### Options\n\n*A more detailed explanation of all options can be found in [the Wiki](https://github.com/cambridge-healthcare/grunt-stencil/wiki/Options).*\n\nEach of the following is optional.\n\n#### options.dot_template_settings\nType: `Object`\nDefault value: `{}`\n\nAn object that specifies the template settings that are passed to the doT compiler (see [doT.js](http://olado.github.io/doT/index.html)).\n\n#### options.env\nType: `Object`\nDefault value: `{}`\n\nInitial environment seen by all compiler, doT.js sees it as `it`. This environment is for each file with their header fields.\n\n#### options.templates\nType: `String`\nDefault value: `\".\"`\n\nA String value specifying the location of all templates. When specified, this will allow to call templates in pages' meta data without the full path to it (the specified `templates_folder` will be prepended).\n\n#### options.partials\nType: `String`\nDefault value: `\".\"`\n\nA String value specifying the location of all partials. When specified, this will allow to call partial `include` functions without the full path (the specified `partials_folder` will be prepended).\n\n#### options.meta_data_separator\nType: `String | RexExp`\nDefault value: `/\\r?\\n\\r?\\n/`\n\nA String value specifying the characters to search for when separating meta data from the content of a file. By default, the JSON header of a file is considered to end after the first blank line in the file.\n\n### Usage Examples\n\n*An elaborate list of examples can be found in [the Wiki](https://github.com/cambridge-healthcare/grunt-stencil/wiki/Examples).*\n\nIn your project's Gruntfile, add a section named `stencil` to the data object passed into `grunt.initConfig()`.\n\n```js\ngrunt.initConfig({\n  stencil: {\n    options: {\n      // Task-specific options go here.\n    },\n    your_target: {\n      // Target-specific file lists and/or options go here.\n    },\n  },\n})\n```\n\n[Grunt's rules for defining target and destination files](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/wiki/Configuring-tasks#files) apply, but care needs to be taken to make sure each input page maps to a single output file.\n\n#### Custom Options\n\nIn this example, doT's it object is used to specify the location of script files and the main title of all pages; and the location of partials and templates is given. All pages in `pages/` will be compiled to `.html` files in `tmp`.\n\n```js\ngrunt.initConfig({\n  stencil: {\n    main: {\n      options: {\n        env: {\n          title: \"Stencil\",\n        },\n        partials: \"content\",\n        templates: \"templates\"\n      },\n      files: [\n        {\n          expand: true,\n          cwd: \"src/pages/\",\n          src: \"**/*.dot.html\",\n          dest: \"tmp\",\n          ext: \".html\",\n          flatten: true\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n  }\n})\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nIn lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Lint and test your code using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/). Please ignore W092 errors (wrapping regexps). The warning will show up until there's an option to disable it in jshint.\n\nYou can run the test suite with `grunt test` or `grunt testv` for more verbose output.\n\nEach new feature ough to have full test coverage. We usually start by writing a fixture which is a pair of two file: the one to process (the fixture) and it's expected output.\nFixture are html or md files in `spec/fixtures`. Any partials and templates required by this fixture should be stored in `spec/partials` and `spec/templates`, respectively. The expected output of a fixture should be put in `spec/expected`.\n\nOnce we run tests and the fixture is failing, we can implement any necessary feature by starting with writing specs (unit tests) in the `spec` directory, (like `spec/my_new_feature_spec.js`) and then implementing it in `lib` directory (`lib/my_new_feature.js`).\n\nOnce all the unit tests pass, we can integrate new code back to the task with making the fixture test pass in mind :) .\n\nIf you take a look at any file in `lib/` you can notice that there's no dependencies between modules. All dependencies are injected in the task file `tasks/stencil.js`. That's the place where the integration happens.\n\n## Release History\n\n- __version 1.0.0__ (7th October, 2013) - first stable release\n- __version 0.1.0__ (4th October, 2013) - big refactor and change of specification\n- __version 0.0.3__ (19th September, 2013) - fix dependencies in `package.json`\n- __version 0.0.2__\n- __version 0.0.1__ (16th September, 2013)\n",
